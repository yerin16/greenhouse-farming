# ðŸŒ¾ Greenhouse Farming Project

The Greenhouse Farming Project is an automated urban farming system designed to grow microgreens in a controlled environment. This project was developed using Arduino-based technology, including sensors and automation systems for lighting, watering, and temperature control. The goal is to explore sustainable food production within urban settings, addressing challenges related to limited land availability and the growing global population.

## Background

The project was created to address the increasing demand for sustainable food production in urban areas. As the worldâ€™s population continues to grow, projected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050, traditional farming practices are no longer sufficient to meet global food needs. This greenhouse system aims to contribute to urban agriculture by using automated processes to grow food efficiently in a small space. The project explores how automation, combined with technologies like sensors and LED lighting, can help cultivate crops with minimal human intervention. It demonstrates how urban farming can reduce the carbon footprint associated with food transportation and help alleviate food shortages in dense cities.

## Features

- **Automated Watering System:** Utilizes a moisture sensor to monitor soil dryness and automatically activate a water pump.
- **LED Lighting:** Provides artificial sunlight to the plants, automatically controlled based on the growth cycle.
- **Temperature Control:** A temperature sensor detects changes in the environment and activates a fan to maintain optimal growing conditions between 22Â°C and 25Â°C.
- **Microgreens Cultivation:** The project grows microgreens, such as mung beans, which can be harvested within 7-14 days, making it ideal for urban farming where space and time are limited.

## Technologies Used
- **Arduino:** Microcontroller used to control the sensors and automate the system.
- **Sensors:** Includes temperature, moisture, and humidity sensors to monitor and adjust the growing conditions.
- **Relay System:** Controls the fan, water pump, and LED lights based on sensor input.
- **Programming:** C++ is used to program the Arduino for managing the sensors and automation features.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to the system could include integrating an IR sensor to detect plant height and notify users when it's time to harvest. Additionally, increasing water capacity or implementing a more advanced water monitoring system could minimize the need for manual water refilling.
